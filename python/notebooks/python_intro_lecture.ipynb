    "A python [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) is a contained mini python world that you run locally. It allows you to save python packages in a directory local to your project, access and manipulate them, and save a state for that specific work.\n",

Or, if you don't have admin privileges on the machine you're running, you might be blocked from installing packages system-wide. These are two cases where you should start up a virtual environment. \n",
