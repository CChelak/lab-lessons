    "We briefly discussed creating test functions for your product code. The [nosetest](https://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/man.html) a package and a suite of tools that can improve your testing experience significantly. Nosetests provides an easier interface for testing your code, and it integrates well with many of the main development tools you’ll use."

    "# Static Code Analysis Linters\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a runtime language, meaning it evaluates each line when it is run. This means checks on code are usually done at the moment the code is run, aside from some basic syntax checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this, many teams have created a series of static code checking tools, called linters. These will evaluate your code as you create it, not as you run, and report warnings and errors that they can find without running the code directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many options, and I’ve found all of them to be chatty and annoying at first in python, but once you configure it to your liking, it will catch mistakes you make way more accurately and quickly than manually running the code each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some common code analyzers:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [pylint](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)\n",

    "# Using virtual environments\n",
    "\n",
    "A python [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) is a contained mini python world that you run locally. It allows you to save python packages in a directory local to your project, access and manipulate them, and save a state for that specific work.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have multiple projects on the same computer, sometimes the need to use different versions of packages to run. Or, if you don't have admin privileges on the machine you're running, you might be blocked from installing packages system-wide. These are two cases where you should start up a virtual environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Probably most importantly, by creating a virtual environment between projects, you can save important environment variables, imports and themes that only apply to that project.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start the virtual environment, run the following from a terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "py -m venv lesson\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A virtual environment should be created in your directory. Look for a folder named `lesson`. See what's inside. Look in the windows explorer, or type the following to see the contents:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "tree lesson\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside a directory called `Scripts`, there is an `activate` file. In terminal, type the file: `lesson\\Scripts\\activate`. Now, your virtual environment is activated, as indicated with the text `(lesson)` at the front of the terminal entry line."
